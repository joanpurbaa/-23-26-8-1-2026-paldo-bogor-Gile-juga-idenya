# Jalur B — Backend

Career & financial resilience platform: membantu pekerja mempersiapkan diri menghadapi PHK dan perubahan dunia kerja sebelum terjadi. See [Plan.md](Plan.md) for the full product spec and [erd.md](erd.md) for the database design.

## Stack

- **FastAPI** + **SQLAlchemy 2 (async)** + **asyncpg**
- **Alembic** for migrations
- **PostgreSQL** (Supabase pooler or local)
- **uv** as package manager

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# edit DATABASE_URL to point at your Postgres instance

# 3. Run migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# 4. Start the dev server
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Health check: `GET http://localhost:8000/health`

## Database

Schema source of truth: `jalurB-v2.erd` (+ [erd.md](erd.md)). After changing anything under `app/models/`:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## Roadmap (features per Plan.md)

1. Career Health Score
2. Career Risk Scanner
3. AI Exposure + Skill Relevance
4. Career Pivot Map
5. Career Evidence Vault
6. Personal Runway
7. What If I Get Fired?

AI behavior, formulas, score thresholds, and limitations are documented in
[`AI_SCORING.md`](AI_SCORING.md).

Auth (register/login) is planned next on top of the existing `users` table.

## Authentication

The API supports password registration/login and Google OAuth:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/google/start`
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback`
- `POST /api/auth/google/exchange`

Google returns a short-lived, single-use exchange code to the frontend. Access tokens
are never included in the OAuth redirect URL. A verified Google identity is linked to
an existing account with the same normalized email only when Google is authoritative for
the address (`gmail.com` or a matching Google Workspace hosted domain). If that form
account was not email verified, its password is invalidated and previous tokens are
revoked during linking to prevent pre-registration account takeover.

Required production environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. Generate a
unique `JWT_SECRET_KEY`; never reuse the Google client secret as the JWT key.
Configure SMTP before enabling form registration; in local `DEBUG=true` mode, email
bodies are written to the backend log.

For a Vercel frontend and separately hosted API:

1. Set `FRONTEND_URL` and `CORS_ORIGINS` to the production Vercel/custom origin.
2. Set a project-specific `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX` only if preview deployments need auth.
3. Set `BACKEND_URL` to the public API origin.
4. In Google Cloud, register this authorized redirect URI exactly:
   `https://<api-domain>/api/auth/google/callback`.
5. Add the frontend production and approved preview origins to Google OAuth's authorized
   JavaScript origins.

## Onboarding API

All onboarding routes require a verified bearer-token user:

- `GET /api/onboarding` returns completion state, profile, and selected skills.
- `PUT /api/onboarding` creates or replaces onboarding data idempotently.
- `GET /api/onboarding/options` returns career goals plus available industries and skills.

`PUT /api/onboarding` accepts canonical backend values:

```json
{
  "full_name": "Joan Orlando",
  "current_role_name": "Backend Engineer",
  "industry_name": "Technology",
  "work_duration_months": 24,
  "is_first_job": false,
  "daily_activities": "Build and maintain APIs",
  "career_goal": "level_up",
  "target_role_name": "Senior Engineer",
  "target_industry_name": "Technology",
  "skills": ["Python", "API Design"]
}
```

Career-goal values are `grow_current`, `level_up`, `change_role`, `change_industry`, and
`undecided`. Skill names are case-insensitively unique, and each user may submit 1–8.

## Profile API

Verified users who completed onboarding can use:

- `GET /api/profile` to retrieve account identity, career profile, and selected skills.
- `PATCH /api/profile` to update profile-owned fields.

## CV Preview API

CV extraction is a two-step review flow. Both write endpoints require a verified user
with an existing profile:

1. Send a PDF or DOCX as multipart field `file` to `POST /api/profile/cv/preview`.
2. Display the returned `profile`, `skills`, and `experiences` to the user for review
   and editing.
3. Send the reviewed values back to `POST /api/profile/cv/confirm` as a JSON body:
   `{"preview_token": "...", "profile": {...}, "skills": [...], "experiences": [...]}`.

The preview response has this shape:

```json
{
  "preview_id": "6956dcb6-1a73-4f86-8201-249a48d738cd",
  "preview_token": "<signed one-hour token>",
  "file_name": "resume.pdf",
  "file_size": 123456,
  "content_type": "application/pdf",
  "expires_at": "2026-09-03T13:00:00Z",
  "profile": {
    "full_name": "Joan Orlando",
    "current_role_name": "Backend Engineer",
    "industry_name": "Technology",
    "work_duration_months": 24,
    "daily_activities": "Membangun dan menjaga API produksi."
  },
  "skills": ["Python", "API Design"],
  "experiences": [],
  "model": "muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free"
}
```

Previewing does not change the profile, skills, career history, or current confirmed CV.
The backend does not retain an unconfirmed file or database draft; the signed preview token
expires after one hour and is bound to the authenticated user.
Confirmation is importer-only: the reviewed values sent by the frontend replace the AI
extraction. It atomically updates non-null edited profile fields, merges edited skills
without removing existing skills, and saves the edited experiences as the CV career
history. Blank profile fields keep the user's existing values. The source CV file is not
stored on the account.
The confirmation endpoint is idempotent when retried with the same token.
Consumed previews cannot overwrite a newer confirmed CV. Files left behind by legacy
stored CVs and replaced CV objects from deleted accounts are removed through a durable
retryable storage-cleanup queue.

- `GET /api/profile/cv` returns the confirmed CV career history and the model used.
- PDF and DOCX are supported up to 5 MB; scanned PDFs without readable text are rejected.
- CV text is sent to the configured Contributor Free model and may be used for model
  training. The frontend must disclose this before upload.

Email and username are intentionally not editable through the profile endpoint.

## Master Data API

Verified users can query paginated skill catalogs with `limit`, `offset`, and optional `q`:

- `GET /api/master/skills` (`category` and `market_trend` filters supported)

Responses use `{ "items": [], "total": 0, "limit": 50, "offset": 0 }`.

## Financial API

All financial routes require a verified bearer-token user. Individual assets are the
source of truth for savings; profile settings only store monthly burn inputs.

- `GET /api/financial` returns settings, assets, totals, and the current runway preview.
- `PUT /api/financial` creates or replaces monthly expense, debt, dependent, and currency settings.
- `POST /api/financial/assets` creates an asset.
- `PATCH /api/financial/assets/{asset_id}` updates an owned asset.
- `DELETE /api/financial/assets/{asset_id}` deletes an owned asset.

Runway is `liquid assets / (monthly essential expenses + monthly debt payment)`.
Assets marked `requires_process` or `illiquid` remain in total assets but do not count
toward runway. All assets must match the profile currency; currency changes are rejected
while assets exist because this API does not perform foreign-exchange conversion.

## Evidence API

Verified users can manage human-authored career evidence:

- `GET /api/evidence` supports type, text, date, `limit`, and `offset` filters.
- `POST /api/evidence` creates evidence and always records it as human-authored.
- `PATCH` and `DELETE /api/evidence/{evidence_id}` operate on owned evidence.
- `POST /api/evidence/{evidence_id}/attachment` optionally attaches one private file.
- `DELETE /api/evidence/{evidence_id}/attachment` removes the attached file.

Creating evidence does not require an attachment. Attachments accept PDF, PNG, JPG, or
WEBP content up to 10 MB and are stored in the configured private Supabase Storage bucket.
Evidence responses contain a signed attachment URL that expires after 15 minutes.

## Dashboard API

`GET /api/dashboard` returns only stored facts and deterministic arithmetic: account and
profile identity, onboarding state, skill counts, evidence totals, and current financial
runway. Missing sections are returned as empty or `null`; no AI scores, generated
recommendations, or placeholder analysis are included.
